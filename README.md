# Memory Overflow

The goal of this repository is to test out different patterns found in [this](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Software-Architecture-Comprehensive-Characteristics/dp/1492043451) book. A good set of notes can be found [here](https://github.com/zhangjunhd/reading-notes/blob/master/software/FundamentalsOfSoftwareArchitecture.md#10layered-architecture-style). The goal is to write a very primative version of stackoverflow and use the different patterns as an exploration excercise. the main branch will be where I host any changes I need to make to the UI and will do a merge to any child branch. Each branch will be name `{chapter number}-{name of the pattern}` so it's easily referenced.
